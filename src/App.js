const story1 = "In the early afternoon of August 28th, 2019, IMED Pune was abuzz with excitement, all set to welcome the newest crop of students. Meanwhile, the freshers were gearing up for the epic Freshers Party 2019. Among these newcomers, we find Devanshi Bajpai, faced with the age-old dilemma: what to wear to the big event. Living in the Air Force hostel, she found herself in a fashion crisis, as her college mates were nowhere to help her, and her hostel mates had vanished, possibly off on thier Wednesday adventures. In this fashion emergency, Devanshi turned to her most beloved confidante ;) , the one and only Rajat Mishra. She summoned him via video call and presented a chaotic array of wrinkled tops, desperately seeking his sartorial counsel.\nYou see, Devanshi hadn\'t given this event a second thought, and in her eyes, her wardrobe was suddenly devoid of anything remotely suitable. Thus began the epic fashion odyssey that unfolded over the next hour or two. Together, they deliberated on the top, the palazzo pants, the choice of sandals, and even the earrings, and so on. Eventually, after a whirlwind of rejections and fashion debates, they settled on an outfit.\nHours later, when Devanshi graced the event with her presence, Rajat, being the devoted friend he was ;) , eagerly requested photos of her in the chosen attire, all ready to shower her with compliments. Little did he know that a wardrobe consultation with her mother had transpired between their video call and the event, resulting in a completely different ensemble. The photos unveiled this delightful revelation, much to Rajat\'s surprise. Nevertheless, as usual, Devanshi looked stunning in her final choice!\nAnd that\'s the saga of how a confusion for attire found its stylish resolution!";

const story2 = "On the early morning of October 17th, 2021, just a few days before celebrating their second anniversary, Devanshi and Rajat were about to reunite. They had spent the past two years apart due to COVID-19 and other challenges. Finally, their long wait was coming to an end as they were going to meet in Devanshi's hometown, Kanpur.\nRecently, Rajat's father had moved to Lucknow, near Rajat, and unfortunately, he had fallen ill with dengue. Rajat had been taking care of his father. He had made sure he could visit Devanshi by completing all his tasks the day before.\nHowever, Devanshi didn't know about the case. She had planned a lovely day starting late in the morning to spend with her boyfriend. But Rajat, who had received a call from his father needing help, rushed to the hospital 15 kilometers away, delaying his journey from Lucknow to Kanpur by about two hours.\nIn the meantime, Devanshi got a bit upset with Rajat for being late. He tried his best to reach Kanpur as quickly as possible but ended up arriving in the afternoon instead of the morning. Despite this hiccup, their love prevailed. They went to the Z-square mall, had fun playing games, and shared a delicious pizza.\nBefore saying goodbye to Rajat on his journey back to Lucknow, Devanshi took him for a short ride to the Ganga barrage. It was there, in the serene beauty of the surroundings, that she made him fall even more in love with her by sharing their first kiss.\nAnd so, on that sunny afternoon, their love story continued to unfold, proving that love could conquer distance and time.";

const story3 = "On the 25th of October 2021, the last day of a three-day-long Electronics branch fest at IET Lucknow, a sweet romantic tale unfolded. Rajat had extended an invitation to Devanshi for the event, marking her very first visit to his college. \"True to her punctual nature\", Devanshi hopped on a morning bus from Kanpur, aiming to arrive by noon. Rajat, who was supposed to be her gallant escort, had an unexpected emergency to handle in the morning as a member of the organizing team. With diligence, he managed to resolve the matter and hurried to Sringar Nagar, where an anxious Devanshi had been waiting for him for nearly an hour. He tenderly apologized and they set off together, embarking on their first journey as companions.\nUpon their arrival, Rajat whisked her away to his cherished cafe, treating her to the delectable 'Kabab-Paratha,' mindful that she hadn't had her breakfast. Then, he proudly introduced her to his circle of friends at the college. As the technical events unfolded, the two decided to sneak away into the college premises for some private enjoyment. Over the course of the day, they relished the festivities of the fest and even danced together.\nLater on, Devanshi's family made an appearance at the college to retrieve her, and Rajat saw her off, bidding her a fond farewell as she departed for Kanpur.\nAmidst the privacy of the college campus, a secret blossomed, one shared only between the couple and the silent lecture theatersâ€”their first intimate encounter, a precious memory that would forever remain hidden within the walls of that academic institution.";

const story4 = "On the 3rd of November in the year 2019, the atmosphere at IET Lucknow was electric, for it was the day of the Covergence 2019 ceremony, a gathering of the Class of '94 on the college grounds. Everything was in place, and all other activities at the college were put on hold, for this day held special significance.\nIn the midst of the excitement, Rajat, a recent addition to the Class of 2019, found himself in his modest room at the first-year boys' hostel. Circumstances had kept him from attending the event, but fate had a different plan for him. His roommate, filled with enthusiasm, had disappeared for the entire day, leaving Rajat alone.\nBut this solitude turned out to be a blessing in disguise, for it gave Rajat the chance to connect with his heart's desire, Devanshi. At 9 AM that morning, he initiated a video call, hoping to find her awake. To his joy, he discovered she was still in the gentle embrace of sleep. With a bit of cajoling, he convinced her to wake up and talk to him.\nTheir conversation was a sweet symphony of love and longing, covering topics that were impossible to recount, even for them. Amidst their talk, they managed their daily routines, but time seemed to slip away unnoticed as their connection deepened. Before they knew it, they had set an unbroken new personal record of a video call lasting more than 12 hours in a single day.\nTheir love story had taken an enchanting turn, transcending time and space as they held onto each other through the magic of technology, cherishing every moment they shared."

const story5 = "Rajat was swamped with college commitments as he navigated the tumultuous first year, especially with his first semester winding down, and the pressure of looming assignment deadlines and assessments bearing down upon him.\nOn the flip side, Devanshi, his girlfriend, had already triumphed over her own first semester. Their history together included a significant date: the 14th of February 2020, their special Valentine's Day.\nHowever, there was a marked difference between the two. Rajat often forgot important dates, but Devanshi was different. She was thoughtful and caring, a quality that set her apart. A few days before Valentine's Day, she cleverly got his address from him, even though he had no idea why she needed it.\nThen came the big day, and when Rajat returned to his hostel in the evening, a surprise was waiting at his door. It caught him off guard and deeply touched his heart. He found a peaceful corner in the hostel to call Devanshi and opened the box of love she had sent him. Inside, he discovered a delightful brownie and pastry. This sweet gesture deepened his love for her even more.";

const story6 = "On the 29th of October 2019, three days had passed since Devanshi and Rajat reunited in Jodhpur during their college break for Diwali. In those three days, they spent a lot of time together, going out on multiple outings and enjoying each other's company.\nDevanshi was very excited about these meetings, but Rajat felt a bit nervous. You see, on the 5th of September 2019, Rajat had confessed to Devanshi that he liked her. Her response was to say no to his proposal but suggested they remain friends. Their mutual friend advised Rajat to express his feelings and care for her in the hope of changing her mind. During these few days, he intended to propose again but couldn't find the right moment.\nHowever, on the late evening of the 29th of October, Devanshi and Rajat found themselves at one of Devanshi's favorite places, the DCafe restaurant. Rajat finally mustered the courage to face his feelings. However, just as he was about to speak, Devanshi received a call from her home and had to leave urgently. Rajat took her back to her neighborhood but stopped the scooter near a park. There, he gathered his thoughts and proposed to her. To his joy, she gracefully accepted his proposal.\nNow, Rajat felt like he was floating on air as he accompanied Devanshi back to her home. During the ride, Devanshi rested her chin on his shoulder, and it gave him a thrilling and entirely new sensation. That was the start of their journey together, and with each passing day, their love only growing stronger.";

const story7 = "After attending his brother's wedding, Rajat returned to Lucknow with a burning desire to meet Devanshi. Devanshi wanted to visit Lucknow too, but she needed a good excuse, and that's where her friend came in. Her friend played a crucial role in the excuse and was the reason Devanshi's family gave her permission to go to Lucknow. They decided on the 16th of February 2022 as the perfect date for their reunion.\nUnfortunately, things took an unexpected turn. Devanshi's friend suddenly had an engagement on the same day, and their plans seemed on the verge of falling apart. Rajat, however, wasn't willing to accept a delay in their meeting. Devanshi found herself caught between her friend and Rajat, and she thought Rajat was being unreasonable and stubborn.\nThankfully, Devanshi's friend managed to resolve her engagement issue and agreed to go to Lucknow on the same day. So, they all set off for Lucknow, though Devanshi was still a little upset.\nOn that eventful day, as they were heading to their meeting spot, Rajat lost his wallet. It was a frustrating setback, but they didn't let it dampen their spirits.\nThey eventually smoothed over Devanshi's anger and decided to visit Janeshwar Mishra Park together. Something magical happened there: a stranger recognized them as a couple, which brought smiles to their faces. And that's how a initially upset Devanshi met Rajat on that day, amidst a backdrop of unexpected twists and turns.";

const story8 = "On the late night of June 24th, 2021, Devanshi and Rajat made a plan to watch a movie together. The movie they chose was called \"Roohi,\" a new and popular film. What made this movie special was that it was the very first time Devanshi and Rajat watched a movie online together. Even more wonderful, it was their first time watching any movie together as a couple. They had a great time watching the movie and spent a beautiful evening together!";

const story9 = "On May 25th, 2023, Rajat was getting ready to visit Kanpur, while Devanshi was about to leave to begin a new chapter of her life in Udupi, via Delhi, as she pursued an MBA. They knew that they wouldn't have many chances to meet for a while, so this meeting held a special significance as it might be their last for some time. Their excitement to see each other was palpable.\nInterestingly, Rajat, who often struggled with punctuality, managed to get everything in order this time and began his journey as planned. To preserve his phone battery, he opted not to share his live location with Devanshi. Instead, he promised to update her on his whereabouts. However, true to his habits, he ended up making a mistake and informed Devanshi only when he was about to enter the city. This led to another one of Devanshi's trademark scoldings that had a special place in his heart.\nDespite this hiccup, Devanshi managed to pick him up, and they headed to a new gaming zone in Z-Square Mall, where she had planned to have him play specific games. Unfortunately, there was a long waiting list, so they couldn't play the games they intended. Nevertheless, they made the most of their time, taking photos together at the gaming zone.\nAfterward, they went to Motijheel in search of some privacy, but luck was not on their side. Rajat's growing annoyance inadvertently upset Devanshi. They decided to take a calming walk and indulged in some delicious street food. Rajat made amends for his actions by lovingly feeding Devanshi.\nAs they headed towards the bus stand, a misunderstanding arose, hinting at a potential street fight. This left Devanshi feeling disheartened about their meet with Rajat. However, he managed to reassure her, helping her see the meeting from a different perspective. They concluded that their first meeting, despite its imperfections, didn't need a kiss and was  a formal date to be memorable.\nThough this was their last meet for a while, they knew that soon they would reunite and continue creating cherished memories together!";



const story10= `On the magical day of February 16, 2024, Rajat's heart leapt with joy as he counted down the moments until he would be reunited with his beloved Devanshi after a nearly agonizing separation of nine months. Rajat had recently joined TCS, a long-awaited career move that had kept him waiting for half a year. Yet, amidst the excitement, misunderstandings had cast a shadow over their loveâ€”particularly his inadvertent oversight on Devanshi's January birthday and his rush back from Kerala without seeing her in Udupi. Despite these trials, fate had brought them back together as Rajat settled into his new role at the Innovation Lab.

Their reunion was meticulously plannedâ€”a weekend carefully chosen as Rajat braced for his new responsibilities and Devanshi prepared to conclude her MBA's first year before a lengthy break in Kanpur. Rajat meticulously organized every detail, with Devanshi's invaluable assistance, ensuring their travel, accommodations, activities, and meals were perfectly orchestrated.

Setting off from work on the evening of February 16th, Rajat embarked on a journey that mirrored the urgency of his longing. From Kazzhakuttam to Varkala Station, and then onwards to Mangaluru Junction without reservations, every mile brought him closer to Devanshi. He kept her updated on his progress, determined not to give her any reason for concern.

Upon arriving in Udupi in the early morning hours, Rajat hurriedly sought out a token of his affectionâ€”a box of chocolates, a sweet tradition between them that spoke volumes of his thoughtfulness. Devanshi, ever practical, had arranged a scooty for their convenience, a testament to her resourcefulness and readiness to join him in their adventures.

Their day unfolded like a symphony of loveâ€”a shared visit to DMart where Rajat's shopping habits contrasted with Devanshi's deliberate selections, a laughter-filled lakeside chat, and a hotel room adorned by Devanshi for their intimate movie session ;). True to their hearts' rhythm, they cherished each moment, from sunset walks on a tranquil beach to cozy dinners and late-evening movie ;), savoring every second before Devanshi's return to her college hostel.

As dawn broke, Rajat found solace in the scent of Devanshi lingering on their shared bed, a fleeting reminder of their perfect moments together. The morning's delay of Rajat's train offered them a precious giftâ€”a final sunrise movie date ;) before bidding  farewell at the station, surrounded by the serene ambiance that mirrored their deep affection.

For Rajat and Devanshi, this reunion was nothing short of magicalâ€”a testament to their enduring love and the indelible memories they created with each tender glance, each shared laugh, and each loving touch. The meet is still considered the best one till now!`;
