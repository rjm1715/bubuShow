Hi baby!

Read this file first to understand some steps to make this work.

(All steps are done assuming that you are using windows10 or windows11)

step1: Move this entire folder(bubushow) to any of your local disks.
step2: Go to start -> Type: Powershell -> open it
step3: Type: cd ~  (now hit enter)
step4: Type: npm install -g npm  (now hit enter and it will take some time to download)
step5: Type: Once the step4 is completed with a successful download, minimize the Powershell
step6: Go to the location of folder(bubuahow), select it
step7: Press: Ctrl+Shift+C
step8: Type: npm start (this again will take some time)
step9: After step8 is completed, minimize the powershell
step10: open any browser on the system, copy paste this in place of url : http://localhost:3000/

All the steps together will take max 10 mins.


In case you get confused, ask me what to do!

Love you!
